## Clustering Coefficient

`clustering_coefficient.py` contains the implementation of the wedge sampling algorithm as depicted in <https://doi.org/10.1145/3183713.3183715>

## Betweenness Centrality

Run `Run_BC.py` to get BC related info about a graph. Simply add the file to the directory `graphs` and write the file name in the array of files of `Run_BC.py`. A results file will be exported to `results_BC` with the name `graph_name.txt`.
